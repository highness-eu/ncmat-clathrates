# ncmat-clathrates

## Generation of ncmat files

### Clathrates

The ncmat files of clathrates are generated by Shuqi Xu on behalf of 
the Work Package 2 of the HighNESS project using the NCrystal internal 
tool NCMATComposer.

The cif files and the phonon density of states (PDOS) are provided by Marco 
Bernasconi and Omar Abou El Kheir from Università di Milano-Bicocca. Details
can be found in the head of each ncmat file.

### Paramagnetic oxygen

We firstly prepared a ncmat file for the Gamma phase of solid oxygen and
then added a supplementray section "@CUSTOM_MAGSCAT" to activate the 
inelastic magnetic scattering physics which is implemented in the plugin: 
https://github.com/highness-eu/ncplugin-MagScat. 

The PDOS of oxygen for different configurations of clathrates, e.g, 
O2-clathrate, THF/TDF+O2-clathrate，are extracted from the corresponding 
ncmat files.

## Combining paramagnetic oxygen into clathrates

The objective is to generate a ncmat file of clathrate whose enclathrated
oxygen molecules have magnetic effects. To do so, we prepared an empty 
clathrate hydrate, and then combined with the paramagnetic oxygen using
the "@OTHERPHASES" section.

## How to use

An example is given: https://github.com/highness-eu/ncmat-clathrates/blob/main/plot_ver_do2-cla.ipynb

Remind that due to the presence of numerous atoms in large unit cell, we
should add "dcutoff=0.5" in the cfg to avoid the cracking of NCrystal.
